# ADPRES

Abu Dhabi Polytechnic Reactor Simulator (ADPRES) solves static and transient diffusion equation for two or three dimensional reactor problems in Cartesian geometry. Currently, ADPRES uses Semi-Analytic Nodal Method (SANM) to spatially-discretized the neutron diffusion equation.

ADPRES is a great learning tool for reactor theory classes. The input is modular and it is designed to be straightforward. ADPRES' main objective is to make all nuclear engineering students have access on similar nuclear computer code. It is open and completely free, so everyone has access to the source code and modify for his/her own purposes.

ADPRES features:
* Solves both static and transient core problems with or without TH feedback
* Performs forward, adjoint and fixed-source problems
* Can handle core problems with Assembly Discontinuity Factors (ADFs)
* Critical boron concentration search
* Rod ejection simulation
* Theta-method to solve transient problems
