# ADPRES

Abu Dhabi Polytechnic Reactor Simulator (ADPRES) solves static diffusion equation for two or three dimensional rectangular geometry. The method used is fourth order Nodal Expansion Method (NEM) where the transverse leakage moments are approximated using quadratic leakage fit. ADPRES can solve either forward or adjoint problems as well as fixed source problems. Among the features of ADPRES are it can handle problem with Assembly Discontinuity Factor (ADF). Currently ADPRES is under extensive development to make it enable solving transient reactor problems.
