# ADPRES

Abu Dhabi Polytechnic Reactor Simulator (ADPRES) solves static and transient diffusion equation for two or three dimensional rectangular geometry. The method used is fourth order Nodal Expansion Method (NEM) where the transverse leakage moments are approximated using quadratic leakage fit. ADPRES can solve either forward or adjoint problems as well as fixed source problems. It also can handle problems with Assembly Discontinuity Factor to imporove the accuracy.

ADPRES' main objective is to make all nuclear engineering students have access on similar nuclear computer code. It is open, so everyone has access to the code, modify for his/her own purposes.
