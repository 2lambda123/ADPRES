# ADPRES

Abu Dhabi Polytechnic Reactor Simulator (ADPRES) solves static diffusion equation for two or three dimensional rectangular geometry. ADPRES can solve either forward or adjoint diffusion equations as well as fixed source problem. ADPRES currently under extensive developments, among these: outer iteration acceleration, the use of assembly discontinuity factor, control rod cusping correction, etc.
